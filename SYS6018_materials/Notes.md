Notes on class:

participation grade should not just be "attending class"

quiz 1.1 -- definition of non-parametric
assignments need to be edited in two places?

discussion should not be moderated
"
in Collab.
Is it possible to turn this feature off?
I've got a very mature student that knows each other and knows what they're doing.

Is it possible to turn off the moderating requirement for the discussion board so that their posts appear right away for people to see? I think they would be much happier with their experience if the time and effort they put into making a post doesn't just get placed into limbo awaiting the pending tag to be removed from their message so they (and everyone else) can enjoy their contribution?

OO dates should be added to the calendar

1.3 interactive quiz 404's -- content needs to be moved

grading scale is pretty wack -- needs to be changed

Partitipation should not just be attendance based, as curretly specified in the syllabus

I don't think quizzes should have 3 attempts... *maybe* two... I would change that going forward...  The instructions would need to be change on the landing page.  It currently says 2 (but gives 3) but I think this should be changed to 1... maybe 2... probably thinking 1... as a way to really ensure reading attention

must enable latex in collab: "Site Info" > "edit site information" > "<check> All display LaTeX.." > "<hit continue>" > "<hit finish>"

Change the due dates on quizzes -- they default to the midnight time, and on the wrong dates (at least for the first time for me)

Remove the "(Optional)" from the section landing pages


Some quizzes don't have lots of quesations. E.g., 10.1 and 10.2, 9.4, 9.2, 8.2, 7.1, 6.3, 6.2, 6.1, 4.2, 4.1, 3.2, 2.4, 2.2

2.3 good questions not currently being used:
A high R2 value indicates that at least one predictor variable is useful for prediction. (False.)
A high F test score indicates that at least one predictor variable is useful for prediction. (True.)
2.3.  Mike's published and working copies don't match. 
I've made my working copy match Mike's published copy.
(and didnt' notice this in time to change my published copy,
which now matches Mike's working copy).
I think all questions are good; though, the F-stat question I reworded --
it wasn't "wrong" but I think it had an overly easy "out" that I've taken 
away now.

discussion forums SHOULD NOT BE MODERATED by default...

MUST change the class policy... "will not respond to retroactive requests"

second homework submission page (after clicking on the landing page) for modules 1-3 is not updated with the landing page.  Modules 4-10 have been updated, so 1-3 need to be updated now. The fixes were only made at module 4 and so the rest of them did not get updated...

where is PCA placed in this course? Like all over... mod4(ch5) and then again in ch6 and ch10... weird??

4.1 interactivity quiz has a link that says "click me" but goes nowhere... "Accepted characters:" message is not showing up

uncheck "allow late submissions" for mods 1-3

# add these pages to the course
Some Tidy Solutions
To be added early Monday after this is due...

class is too busy around the time of the project

Precision/ROC curve is much better for the project

"which model is BEST" is really throwing students off the sent of "sampling variability"...
- they are just relying on point estimates of things rather than thinking about the uncertainty associted with these estimates (even just from K-folds scores itself...)

Students do not generalkly come up with their own conclusions... so you might want to revist the promts and make sure tthey're the ones you want students answering.

notes to class about projects:
- you're doing all this again, but even more, facilitating ease with reusable code is very important...
- I need to discuss out of sample scoring...
- You will do Recall/Precision curves instead

better tables for project... it asks for "best" and it doesn't give a spot for variability

mod 7 DT assigned problem 7 (ch 8) which should be put in the RF mod 8

the material for quiz 7.2 was in module 7.3 ).

Allow resubmissions should probably be on.  But resubmissions after the deadline are no good.  Make sure you're comfortable with the submissions details.


I have midterm feedback (collected week of mod 8) to share

In mod 9 it says "as I showed in mod 10" (regarding the data munging)


mod 9/10 have old versions of the project (that didn't get removed in time)

I removed the mod 10 interactive video... it's too terrible...

Determine how students want to submit homeworks with the students?
Determine multiple submissions settings...

11.1 link needs updating to: https://wiki.pathmind.com/neural-network
"A Beginner's Guide to Neural Networks and Deep Learning"

quizzes 11.2 11.3 are deleted from website?


Allow more quiz answers!! Qestion 4 12.2
Mod 12 quiz says answer is 12-13; but, that's only for a single data set.
GBM light is actually closer to 3x faster than XGBoost.


The quizzes on decision trees appeared to be much harder than other content

The scores table is not correctly listed for the project -- it has 1/2 when it should be 1/4 points.  We also don't need to see the tuning levels again in this table, do we?  And we can remove the ROC requirement in Table 3

Students did not "get" the exercise of "FHO didn't work because it was overfit"
Positive/Negative class were a big stumbling block for people

Moving Reimbursement From Stockholm Sweden to Charlottesville, VA area (subject to the execution of a moving agreement and all applicable policies)


The hidden cost of taxes on moving expenses is extremely unappreciated and has had an extremely adverse impact in my decision to utilize to use the moving expense benefit.

I do not appreciate this in the least.

I suggest you alert future hires to the fact that moving expenses are taxable so that they understand the actual value of that benefit when you offer it.
