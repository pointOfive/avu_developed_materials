DIRECTIONS

You will continue to work on this document for the checkpoint and final report, so make sure to get familiar with the template and how to write the research manuscript. Your project proposal should include the following information:

Motivation: What problem are you tackling? 
Dataset: What dataset (with URL) are you using?
Related work:
A review of the literature is a classification and evaluation of what accredited scholars and researchers have written on a topic. In writing a literature review, your purpose is to convey what knowledge and ideas have been established on a topic, and what their strengths and weaknesses are. A literature review consists of an overview, a summary, and an evaluation/critique of the current state of knowledge about a specific area of research. It may also include a discussion of methodological issues and suggestions for future study. As you have selected a topic of interest, it would be to your benefit to expand your knowledge about the topic. A literature review should demonstrate the following:
Be organized around and related directly to the topic or research question you are developing
Synthesize results into a summary of what is and is not known
Identify areas of controversy in the literature 
Formulate questions that need further research
Intended experiments: What experiments are you planning to run? How do you plan to evaluate your machine learning algorithm?
