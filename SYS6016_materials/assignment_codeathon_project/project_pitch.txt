a project title (providing a good sense of your proposal)
your name and project id number <- "project id number" will be provided to you in time to add to your slide
[OPTIONALLY] a graphic or diagram that helps give a sense or a "hook" for your project
a link to your data (to eventually be clicked and briefly described)

Each student turns in three `dicts`:  
`{your_project_id_number: (id_1_ideal_project_match, id_2_ideal_project_match, ...)} # INCLUDING YOUR OWN IF YOU REMAIN INTERESTED IN YOUR OWN PROJECT`
`{your_project_id_number: your_name}`
`{your_project_id_number: your_project_title}`
[OPTIONALLY] some redundancy notes to provide a way to confirm accuracy of the above in case something goes wrong `{project_id_number_1: "identify information like student name and project name", project_id_number_1: "identify information like student name and project name", ...}`
