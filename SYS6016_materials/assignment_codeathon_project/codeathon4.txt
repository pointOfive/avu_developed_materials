Assignment 4: Implementing Atari Space Invaders with TF-Agents
Due: 5/13 3:30PM EST (before Final Presentations)
Late: 0 (after 3:30PM EST beginning with the start of Final Presentations)
Value: 100 points (10% of class grade)
In this assignment, you will apply a DQN to the OpenAI Atari Space Invaders environment. Training RL agents on Atari environments is hard, as it can be a very time-consuming process as the environment complexity is high, especially when the agent needs to visually interpret objects directly from images.

DIRECTIONS

In this assignment, you will use TF-Agents to train an agent that can achieve a superhuman level at SpaceInvaders-v4 using DQNs. To make it easier for you, you may follow the tutorial on how to implement the game with TF-Agents in the Optimized Space Invaders article below. Some codes have been provided to help you process the data; you may modify it to fit your needs.

All of your code must be in the Jupyter Notebook format. If you use Github, please include a zip file or, preferably, a link to a Github repository with the code for your final project. You do not have to include the data or additional libraries.
