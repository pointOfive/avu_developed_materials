Value: 20 points (2% of class grade)
ML4VA EPISODE 2: THE STAKE HOLDER

In the project proposal, you’ll pick a project idea to work on early. If your proposed project will be done jointly with a different class’s project, you should obtain approval from the other instructor and approval from us.

DIRECTIONS

You will continue to work on this document for the checkpoint and final report, so make sure to get familiar with the template and how to write the research manuscript. Your project proposal should include the following information:

Motivation: What problem are you tackling? Is this an application or a theoretical result?
Dataset: Presenting a URL to a dataset you found.
