    "### About This Syllabus\n",
    "\n",
    "This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. It is up to the student to stay sufficiently engaged in course to be aware of any potential changes and updates. The final authority on any decision in this course rests with the course instructor, not with this document.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prerequesites\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior to taking this course, you should meet the following prerequisites:\n",
    "- At least one programming course\n",
    "- Regression Analysis\n",
    "- Machine Learning/Data Mining\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are strongly recommended:\n",
    "- Programming in Python (since Python will be used in this course)\n",

The system is highly catered to getting you help fast and efficiently from classmates, the TA, and myself. We encourage you to ask questions when you're struggling to understand a concept. The quicker you begin asking questions on [Piazza?/Slack?], the quicker you'll benefit from the collective knowledge of your classmates and instructors.

    "#### Programming Assignments\n",
    "There will be three programming assignments. Each assignment will be graded for correct implementation, results, a thorough discussion of the results, and good organization, grammar, and spelling. This is a programming course, and doing the programming assignments is absolutely critical (and accounts for 30% of your grade). If the results you see when running your program do not match the results that the TA reports for your program, you should talk to the TA promptly. However, in all but the rarest of cases, you should be prepared to understand that the definitive test of your code is that made by the TA and what you are seeking in talking to the TA is an understanding of how to avoid losing points over similar discrepancies in the future. To put this another way, you should contact the TA, but if you understand why there is a difference, you should not assume that your assignment will be re-graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Codeathons\n",
    "There will be three codeathons on designing deep neural network architectures to solve complex technological, business, and societal problems. Make sure you get your hands dirty on the code. Hands-on is the best way to learn machine learning. You also have opportunities to tackle real-world scenarios. You are expected to demonstrate a strong understanding and in-depth analysis of the solution in each codeathon.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Video Quizzes\n",
    "There will be 10 quizzes during the course of the semester. Each quiz will assess student knowledge and application of topics covered in the videos. Any quiz that is missed due to an absence that is not a university-excused absence will result in a zero (0) for that grade. Any quiz that is missed due to a university-excused absence or due to circumstances that are approved by me beforehand must be made up within a week of the missed quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Textbook Quizzes\n",
    "For each assigned Deep Learninig textbook chapter, an in class quiz will help students test and assess their knowledge and understanding of the material covered in readings. Any quiz that is missed due to an absence that is not a university-excused absence will result in a zero (0) for that grade. If a quiz is going to be missed due to a university-excused absence or due to circumstances approved by the professor beforehand must be completed prior the \"in-class quiz date\" (which is a generally available option).\n",
