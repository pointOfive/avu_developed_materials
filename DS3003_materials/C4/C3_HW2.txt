share information about conflict resolution/addressing frustration

1. Find any "article" (news article, blog post, study/report, etc.) about "conflict resolution" or "addressing frustration" in professional work contexts that catches your interest
- Generally, the content you address can boil down to "what can you do when an interpersonal professional situation becomes upsetting?"   ​
- "Reserve" this article by creating a post on the discussion board with your article title as the post title and a means to access article as the post message.​
- If an article was already selected before you reserve it you will not get credit for presenting the article. (both in class and in the discussion board)
- Choose topics like
"How often are people frustrated at work?"​/"What do people get frustrated about at work?"
"How can you slow down conflict escalation?"/"What is healthy versus unhealthy conflict?"
"How can disagreement be approached constructively?"​/"What makes small groups/teams succeed?"
"What is assertiveness is and how it can be exhibited?"/"What is an effective 'language' or approach for conflict resolution?"
"How do you deal with a challenging boss?"/"How do you manage difficult employees?"
2. Edit your post your article on the discussion board to include with a 2-4 sentence summary describing the context and the healthy conflict resolution strategy, or approach to handling and addressing frustration as presented and discussed in your article.
[I WOULD MAKE 3 REQUIRED AND NOT A BONUS]
3. Bonus points are available if the article includes any graphic or data presentation, and you can well-articulate a positive or negative critique of the graphic/data analysis (both in class and on the discussion board)
- Add one additional sentence giving your opinion as to if the data is easily accessible
4. Be able to convey the healthy strategy for conflict resolution/addressing frustration promoted by your article in about a minute -- no longer than 90 seconds!
5. 15/30 (volunteers and randomly selected) students will (briefly) share their article
- 1 point for the presentation, and 1 point for staying under 90 seconds
- Describe the method for addressing conflict resolution and/or dealing with frustration
