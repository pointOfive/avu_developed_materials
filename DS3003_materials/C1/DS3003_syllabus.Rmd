Graded or for Credit Undergraduate Course.  Choose between:

- February 1-16
- April 23-30

*This syllabus is to be considered a reference document that can and will be adjusted through the course of the semester to address changing needs. It is up to the student to stay sufficiently engaged in course to be aware of any potential changes and updates. The final authority on any decision in this course rests with the course instructor, not with this document.*

# Description

Are you interested in getting your hands dirty coding up some data visualizations?
Are you ready to discuss contentious topics from an evidence-based, "data first" perspective?
Do you want to participate in  "article take-downs",
or champion contributions of exceptional reporting and information sharing?
If so, you're in the right place!
In this class your job is to seek out and share
information, to present the meaning in data in fun and cool ways,
and to appreciate, help, and learn from others doing the same thing!

## Content

### Textbook

There is no textbook for this class, as our textbook will be the world will as
it appears before us; however, as such, students will both supply and be 
supplied with content over the course of the course from sources such as 
[Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org),
[The New York Times](https://www.nytimes.com),
[FiveThirtyEight.com](https://fivethirtyeight.com), 
[Medium.com](http://medium.com), 
[The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com), 
[TIME](https://time.com), and
[National Geographic](https://www.nationalgeographic.com), *etc.*


### Coding

The primary language for this course will be R,
which is a very popular and highly ubiquitous 
programming language designed for statistical data analysis and 
visualization.  Instructions, resources, and materials to help students
work with and use R -- 
such as those available from the 
[ggplot2 book](https://ggplot2-book.org/index.html), 
[R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz),
the [R Cookbook](http://www.cookbook-r.com), 
[Tidyverse](https://www.tidyverse.org),
[Plotly](https://plotly.com/r/), [Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com),
and *plain old [google](https://www.google.com/?client=safari) web searches* --
will be made available at appropriate times to support student efforts at each 
stage of the course. 
R and all of these additional resources are (*of course!*) available for free.


### Data

For several assignments and your final project you'll be telling your
own story with data. These days it's actually fairly easy to get your hands
on interesting data!

## Objectives

Students will gain

1. exposure to and experience with critical evaluation (of both ones own as well as others)
communications involving data presentation and visualization
    - *appreciation of uncertainty and weariness of the "cardinal sins" of message manipulation*
4. practice creating tailored communications leveraging purposeful data 
summarization and representation in support of a messaging objective 
    - *a sense of the prevalent techniques in use today, and what makes them powerful and compelling*
2. hands-on technical skills in coding data visualization in R using ggplot2, Plotly, 
and Shiny
    - *empowerment in both internal understanding (of data) and external communication (of findings)*
5. a portfolio piece of their own creation showcasing 
communication and visualization skills
    - *each student will individually present a final project presentation and associated report* 
3. extensive experience interacting in groups and other social contexts
    - *during the courses initial "learning phase" all coding assignments will be group assignments*

## Honor Code

Work which should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the 
University of Virginia *will be explicitly noted*. Generally speaking, group work 
will require no pledge (and indeed collaboration is *intended* and *expected*
for these assignments); while later individual assignments require either of the
following statements:

- "I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this [examination/quiz/assignment]."
- "I have [received/given] help on this assignment [to/from] [student]; the nature
  of this support was [elaborate]."
