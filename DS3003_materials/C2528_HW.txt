1. Pick HALF (rounded up) of the day's presentation which you thought were "the best"
2. Reply to at least THREE project post in the discussion forums from this classes presentations with a question or comment about the presentation
- PRESENTERS: monitor and respond to questions!!
3. Make a distinct plot using some of the data from the class presentations you've seen so far 
I.e., if you've already made a certain kind of plot for these exercises, e.g., a scatter plot, your plot must be a different kind of plot 
Each submission must use data you not yet used; and must be cumulative (i.e., contain all plots made so far)
Provide an explanation of the data set, the subset of the data set you're using, and the the plot you created
Include comments in your code which would allow someone else to readily understand each code line of your implementation
Submit a nice looking .Rmd knitted .html

Include either of the following in your submission text box: 

- "Honor Pledge: I have [given and/or received] the following help [to and/or from] <student> to complete this submission: <explain help utilized>"

- "Honor Pledge: I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment."
