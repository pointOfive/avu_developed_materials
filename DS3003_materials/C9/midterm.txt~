Midterm Presentation: find an article AND RELATED DATA SET (to support or argue against your article) that you would like to raise awareness about in our class

Don't be afraid to present controversial or hot button topics and hot takes.  E.g., if something along the lines of any of these topics interests you, it is a suitable topic options: Covid and/or Governmental and Healthcare Industry Response Ability; the Climate and/or Economic Progress; Vaccines and/or Relative Risks of Global Health Issues; Healthcare and/or Disparity; Vegetarian Heath and/or Meat Production Efficiency; Fluoride in Drinking Water and/or Socio Economic Disparate Impact; Social Justice (e.g., Black Lives Matter) and/or Gender Bias (e.g., Feminism: the radical notion that women are people). Or don't be afraid to NOT work on things as heavy as those above and instead present something YOU want to!  E.g., is coffee bad for you?  Etc. Etc. Etc.

"Reserve" this article and data set by creating a post on the discussion board with your article title as the title and (a) a means to access article, (b) a link to a data set which you can argue is relevant, related to, and informative of the article you've chosen, and (c) the class day you'd like to present on (i.e. 13-16) as the message.â€‹

- If an article was already selected before you reserve it you will not get credit for presenting the article.
- Class day preferences are first come first serve and come with the following grading bonus
Class 13: +3
Class 14: +2
Class 15: +1
Class 16: 0

- Class day presentation assignments will be finalized and announced as spots fill up
- If you change the article you're presenting on you will lose your spot
- Bonus points may be awarded for exceptionally impressive graphical data presentations (so if you've missed out on the "going early" bonuses, extra credit is still available to you via a "more time to make better graphics" path)

1. For your Midterm presentation you will give a 8-minute presentation which will be evaluated by the class according to this Rubric, i.e., your presentation will be evaluated based on
- how engaging it is
- how visually attractive it is
- how well it explains the article
- how insightfully it evaluates the article
- how unbiased it's evaluation of the article is
- and finally, how nicely the related data is presented

2. The data set presentation needs to be a single visual plot of some sort which verifies that you have indeed found some data of relevance to the article

- You need to justify the relevance of the data to the article you've chosen
- A good way to do this is make a plot which relates to and informs the article itself
- Remember: bonus points may be awarded for exceptionally impressive graphical presentations
