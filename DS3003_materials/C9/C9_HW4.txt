[GROUP HOMEWORK]: submit a knitted "group" `.html` file showing you code and following figures

Only a single "group figure" is required for Parts 1-3 above; however, the comments provided (Part 4) in that code must be created and contributed by the group as a whole. For part 5, each group member must contribute a unique figure to the groups submission in order for all group members to get credit for this homework. If only some members of the group contribute figures in the submitted `.Rmd` file, those group members must additionally provide a supplemental explanation along with their submission as to why other students in their group have not contributed to this assignment.

1. Title your document and use sections and subsections to organize all team member's code and figures into a well organized and visually pleasing and attractive presentation
2. Each must provide some exposition explaining the data set, the subset of the data set they're using, and the the plot they created
3. Each student should include comments in their code which would allow someone else to readily understand each code line of their implementation
