Class Discussion: Covid Mask Articles

Relate to the uncertainty discussions from last class
I suggest you think of "personal bias" as a perspective, or model of the world, much in the same way the modeling choices you make lead to different results
Ex 1: the "Stats Guys" climate reconstruction differs from Dr. Mann's climate reconstructions
Ex 2: the different covid infection models from OWID probably differed for quite a few of the counties you looked at Class 8 assignment 
So, just as we need to question "personal bias", we should question modeling assumptions
And we should be VERY interested in uncertainty reporting about modeling results
If possible, it's great to see a "sensitivity analysis" of modeling choices:
I think this is what the "stats guys" "uncertainty in climate reconstruction" actually provided for us

And remember -- there is often a lot of uncertainty in "reported point estimates": these are just "best guesses"
remember our "politico article" where the guy was mad that point estimates with huge uncertainty were not spot on
don't do that... understand that there is uncertainty in everything
take that into account!


Stuff I didn't do, but could possibly be designed for controlled use that would have been more effective than the attempted "class discussion".

1) we just never did this one:

Read 50 Reasons to Oppose Fluoridation: http://www.fluoridealert.org/wp-content/uploads/50-reasons.pdf
Read the Chapter on Benefits (pages 13-32) in the American Dental Associations' Fluoridation Facts publication: https://www.ada.org/~/media/ADA/Files/Fluoridation_Facts.pdf?la=en
Come to class prepared to discuss the various (de)merits of these publications!

2) here we could have explored material related to presentation I gave
