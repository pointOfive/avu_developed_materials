- Could be useful to take a look at Eric's Syllabus?

Conversation summary from [initial 9/9 meeting](initial_meeting.Rmd):

> To use Eric's phrase, Mike would like a course more focussed on communication ABOUT data, (models, etc.) while Raf would like a course more focussed on communicating WITH data (as is done sometimes well in the Times or the Atlantic). At the risk of selectively highlighting and pigeonholing Eric's thoughts and considerations, I felt the primary issue in his view was managing course overlap. I felt Jon's suggestions to orient around topics or guest speakers (--that might have been from Eric, actually-- I can't remember who suggested that) was extremely interesting, and I further thought Jon was very helpful in continuing to draw the conversation back to practical definites that will inevitably eventually present themsevles for consideration.  And over the whole conversational thread is the primary inevitability that this course should set students up to start a deep dive into data visualization tools.


# SDS 3003: Communicating with Data

## Learning Objectives (from [Communicating with Data Learning Goals](https://myuva.sharepoint.com/:w:/r/sites/UndergraduateCurriculumCommittee/_layouts/15/doc2.aspx?sourcedoc=%7Bde4ab42d-876c-446c-8fc2-16198cfb5660%7D&action=edit&wdPid=59b47bb6&cid=1e12ca84-518d-4f2e-8da5-35eb24e27f6e)):

1. Integrating data [especially visualizations] into communications [presentations/representations] can be powerful and compelling! [the course is meant as a HOOK]
0. Experience/Exposure to critically evaluating data/analysis/visually driven communication
2. Visualization also empowers the analyst "internally" (in addition to "externally") 
5. Burgeoning power user of <ggplot/plotly>
8. Portfolio piece showcasing communication and visualization
6. Experience deploying <shiny/bokeh> dashboard
7. Weariness of "cardinal sins" sometimes used to manipulate messaging
   - first and foremost of which are the various failures to appreciate uncertainty
<!--- 3. Famous "breakthroughs" and the "best practices" engendered therein/thereafter -->
4. Awareness of additional/alternative "state of the art" visual communication tools




## Synopsis 

Data scientists communicate in numerous ways along all stages of the analysis pipeline, with visualization being one of the important methods for both understadning data "internally" and representing findings externally, especially in the final "home stretch" of delivering results and recommending actionable insights.  This course will introduce students to the best practices and tools that exist to support data scientists communicate findings in effective, compelling, creative, and accurate ways.  The orientation of the course will be concerned with graphical communicatiton, but will address communication generally (as it pertains to data scientists), and will additionally devote considerable attention to understanding and correcting manipulations of truthfulness that can manifest themselves in data analysis and visual presentation contexts.  After taking this course, students should be (a) prepared to pursue a deep dive into advanced data visualization technologies, (b) present findings and data-driven arguments to diverse audiences each having different levels of technical ability and expertise, and (c) be conscientious and critically capable consumers of data analysis and visually driven communications/argumentation.

I have not found a textbook that quite suits what I think we're looking to do with this class...
I am thinking I will use publically available publications/content?



teismann, uri berkeley/ut now from 70s


I still feel that Communicating About Data (i.e., the science of summarizing data for human understanding or the science of extracting and communicating the information in data) would be a more valuable course than this, but wonâ€™t push it anymore. If we are to be data science, then every class should be about both data and some science related to data (e.g., science of communicating with data, science of summarizing data). If design = visualization, then so be it.

In the current proposal, my only two comments are that I think all the R/ggplot static stuff should be covered in the intro course and do not see the need to spend 2 weeks on communication in general.

Thanks for leading this effort Brian! Itâ€™s still good minor and good class.


28-30
