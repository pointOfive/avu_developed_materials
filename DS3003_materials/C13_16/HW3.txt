Make one of the following plots using data presented by one of the presentations so far

Submit this in the usual, nicely organized and outlined knitted .Rmd/.html format.

Histogram and KDE Plots
Box or Violin Plots
Time Series Plots
3D scatter plot
You will make each of these over the four days of the midterm presentations, one on each presentation day; although, you're welcome to choose which one you want to make on any given day according to which presentation's data interests you the most.

1. Each submission will be cumulative, i.e., contain all plots made so far.

2. Code should be well commented in each submission

3. An exposition of the data and explanation of the plot should be included with each figure.

Include either of the following in your submission text box: 

"Honor Pledge: I have [given and/or received] the following help [to and/or from] <student> to complete this submission: <explain help utilized>"
"Honor Pledge: I have neither given nor received aid on this assignment."
