- Everything in the first level of the C3 directory relates to the "Learning" topic
- The C3/Communicating_Overtime subdirectory has all the material related to the "Communicating" topic
- Student presentations took too much time and so the schedule got very messy and I did things as I was able to time-wise
- I.e., I didn't do much of my original plan regarding the "Communicating" topic

Regarding the C3/Communicating_Overtime directory:
- all I had time to do in the 3rd class was present and describe the webpage: https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/11/21/science/artificial-intelligence-fake-people-faces.html
- my thoughts on the content of this page, as an example of making asynchronous communication feel more syncronous are given in the first 7 slides of DS3003_Communicating.png
- I then started the next class with the following PollEv questions to follow up on this:
