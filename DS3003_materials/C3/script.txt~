Judge for yourself based on the slides how much time you'd need to present this material, but I think it pretty comfortably fit into ~30 minutes for me.

Slides/PollEv:

s1. See Notes in .pptx
s2. See Notes in .pptx
s3. get students to complain "graph is cut off"
s4. Fixes this

ask these questions and discuss answers:
q1. Is altering the impression a plot makes justified?
    No -- not when the numerical impression is changed or misleading
    Yes -- if the adjustment is clear and clarifying for the point being made
q2. And what about this presentation [q2.png]? It is
    arbitrarily adjusting the numerical impression in a potentially misleading manner.
    sufficiently justified in portraying a less accurate numerical impression.
q3. And how about this [q3.png]? It is
    arbitrarily adjusting the numerical impression in a potentially misleading manner.
    sufficiently justified in portraying a less accurate numerical impression.

s5-9. See Notes in .pptx

ask these questions and discuss answers:
q4. Have you found the presentation on spaced repetition compelling?
    Yes!
    No...
q5. Did you find that the addition of the citation strengthened the presentation?
    Yes!
    No...
q6. Have I sufficiently convinced you that repetition is an effective strategy to improve long-term knowledge retention in your learning pursuits?
    Yes!
    No...

But the thing is, this citation is wrong: Ebbinghaus only worked on the "forgetting curve" -- not "spaced repitition"

s10-12. See Notes in .pptx; s11 is a good example of log transform that could be emphasized!

ask these questions and discuss answers:
q7. Regarding "Reproducibility" [q7.png]:
    Reproducibility of findings is an extremely important part of the scientific process
    We should strive to ensure that our own analyses and findings are reproducible
q8. Which Visualization per se do you prefer? I.e., which makes the point most effectively?
    A: [q8A.png]
    B: [q8B.png]
q9. Have I sufficiently convinced you that repetition is a key to learning [q10.png]?
    Yes!
    No...

But the thing is, this is just a drawing...

s13. See Notes in .pptx

ask these questions and discuss answers:
q10. Have I sufficiently convinced you that repetition is a key to learning []?
    Yes!
    No...
q11. Do you think I personally WANT to convince you to employ "Spaced Repetition" in your learning efforts?
    Yes!
    No...
q12. Do you think you need to be convinced about the effectiveness of "Spaced Repetition"; or, does it already make sense to you?
     It's pretty intuitively clear that "Spaced Repetition" can help with information retention.
     I would need to see more data quantifying the effectiveness to justify changing my learning habits.

But this is interestinig, because it has to do with personal bias(?)/experience?

s14-16. See Notes in .pptx

ask this questions and discuss answers:
q13. Are you okay with simplifying a message, as in the left figure [q13.png]?
    Yes!
    No...

and if you flip next on PollEv you'll be back to the beginning to remind them about this question,
and might add another question to see if anybody would change their mind at this point

s17: I didn't discuss... not enough time
