share information about communication

1. Submit by 2:30 PM EST 2/9
2. Find any "article" (news article, blog post, study/report, etc.) about "communication" that catches your interest
- Generally, the content you address should be concerned with the question "What are some challenges in communication?" and discuss "Techniques that can be used to address the challenges of communication".
- **"Reserve" this article by creating a post on the discussion board with your article title as the post title and a means to access article as the post message.​**
- If an article was already selected before you reserve it you will not get credit for presenting the article.
- There are many mediums of/for communication, so the article should be focused on a specific kind of communication, for example:
- "How to improve communication to others about your <code/analysis/project>"
- "How to communicate in confrontational circumstances"
- "How to communicate effectively in presentations"
- "How to communicate effectively in textual mediums (e.g., emails)"
- "How to argue persuasively for something you're passionate about"
- "How to communicate data science effectively to lay audiences"

3. Bonus points are available if the article includes any graphic or data presentation, and you can well-articulate a positive or negative critique of the graphic/data analysis (both in class and on the discussion board)
- Add one additional sentence giving your opinion as to if the data is easily accessible
4. Edit your post your article on the discussion board to include with a 2-4 sentence summary describing communication context, and a method recommended to improve communication in that context ​(and graphic with your positive or negative graphic critique if you have it)
