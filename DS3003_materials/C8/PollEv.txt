q1. What do you make of this association? [q1.png]

It looks strong
It looks noteworthy
It's unconvincing

q2. What do you make of the association now (top versus bottom)? [q2.png]
It still looks strong
It's less impressive now
It's still unconvincing

q3. What does it mean if throwing away certain data points changes our opinion of something?
Well, you can't just "throw away" data!
Maybe we didn't have enough data to‎start with?
Our impression on a set of data is guided by specific influential data points...

q4. The squared correlation "R" in this data is about sqrt(2). By the way, two of these are true s*tatements. Which two are true? [q1.png]
*Correlation is between -1 and 1
*Slope describes the linear change in y in response‎to changes in x; Correlation describes the variability of data around the linear association
The greater the correlation, the steeper the slope
Correlation measures the uncertainty of the linear association

q5. The plot we've been looking at uses R^2 rather than R (which we're focussing on)... have you heard R^2 described as "the proportion of variance explained"? [q1.png]
Yes
No

q6. [You have three votes; you can choose one answer twice]: What's a good phrase to describe CORRELATION, a measure of the variability of points off of a line? [q1.png]
Strength of Association
Significance of Association
Degree of Association
Evidence of Association
Magnitude of Association

q7. [You have three votes; you can choose one answer twice]: What's a good phrase to describe SLOPE, the average change in Variable Y for a single unit increase in Variable X? [q1.png]
Strength of Association
Significance of Association
Degree of Association
Evidence of Association
Magnitude of Association

q8. [You have three votes; you can choose one answer twice]: What's a good phrase to describe STATISTICAL UNCERTAINTY in an estimate of SLOPE or CORRELATION? [q1.png]
Strength of Association
Significance of Association
Degree of Association
Evidence of Association
Magnitude of Association

q9. Leaving the question of statistical uncertainty aside for now, what's the most accurate interpretation of this plot? [q1.png]
Countries that did not wait to institute‎masking policies prevented COVID deaths‎through masking, on average‎
Countries tend to not institute masking‎policies until pressured to by their number‎of COVID deaths‎
*Either or Both of the above explanations (or‎even other explanations as well) could be‎contributing to this observed association‎
*Countries which wait longer to institute‎masking policies also tend to have more‎COVID deaths‎
